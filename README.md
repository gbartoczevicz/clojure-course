# Clojure Course

Code created from the [Clojure: The Complete Beginner's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/clojureprogramming/) course lessons

## Usage

- I highly recommend the use of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) as the code editor for Clojure
- Alongside IntelliJ I've used the [Cursive plugin](https://cursive-ide.com)
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) as the Clojure project manager
- Use the build-in 'Run' from IntelliJ to execute each file from `src/clojure_course` dir
- Personally I like to use [sdkman](https://sdkman.io) to manage the both Java and Leiningen local versions :)
